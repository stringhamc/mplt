MPLT (My Plot)
==============

A few wrappers around matplotlib easing some common plots that Signal
processing engineers like to use, such as plotting complex signals (real
and imaginary or magnitude and phase).

Usage
-----

Note that mplt import all of pyplot’s attributes, so there is no need to
import matplotlib.pyplot as well

.. code:: python

    import mplt
    mplt.myfig('test')
    mplt.implot(np.exp(1j*np.linspace(0,5,200)))
